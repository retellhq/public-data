# Weekly Permit Upload
## How to use this repository

### Requirements
The data ingestion task runs weekly from 00:00:00-02:00:00 UTCâˆ’06:00 (US Central) on Tuesday and will ingest `.csv` files for each market dated for the day prior. For example, the task scheduled for July 27 2021 will ingest these three files located in the repository: `20210726_Austin.csv` `20210726_Dallas Fort Worth.csv` `20210726_Houston.csv`

Files uploaded to this folder must be `.csv` and the filename must match this format with the date format being `YYYYMMDD` and the market being case-sensitive.

Files must be uploaded weekly before Tuesday and dated for the preceding Monday to be automatically be ingested and available by 3AM Tuesday.

### How to upload for automatic ingestion
Files may be uploaded using a web browser by visiting https://github.com/retellhq/public-data/tree/main/permit-data and clicking the `Add File` button near the top

## Performing a manual ingestion task on files in this repository
If weekly files were not uploaded by the following Monday but were added after the task has run then a Druid index task can be manually submitted using the Druid dashboard under the ingestion tab.

The following json template is to be used for each file that needs to be ingested with these lines replaced:
 - URL on `line 9` replaced with the link to the raw file hosted on GitHub
